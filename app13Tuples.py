#tuples are like lists to store objects but we cant change them once we create them
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 3)
#numbers[0] = 10    #Error because tuple once created cant be changed

#tuples has only count and index methods
numero = (10, 20, 30, 30)
numero.count(30) #2 because theres 2 of 30
numero.index(20) #1
